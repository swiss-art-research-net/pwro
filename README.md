## Power, War, Religion and Relations Ontology Repository Description ##

This repository exists to provide a point of access for users to download the stable releases of the Power, War, Religion and Relations Ontology (PWRo). 

PWRo is built in reference to and extending the AAAo standard (https://ontology.swissartresearch.net/aaao/) as well as CIDOC CRM (https://www.cidoc-crm.org) and is designed to support the representation of historical data dealing with events related to power, war, religion and relations.

* Namespace: https://ontology.swissartresearch.net/pwro/
* Prefix: pwro

This repository is maintained through a collaboration between:

* the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (https://www.sari.uzh.ch/en.html)
* Takin.solutions (https://takin.solutions)

PWRo is developed and maintained using the OntoMe tool. The project space for PWRo can be found here:

* https://ontome.net/project/208

Changes to the ontology are managed through that tool.

Discussions, suggestions and queries relative to the ontology should be raised using the issues feature of this repository.

In this repository users will find the different stable versions of PWRo which can be used for creating, managing and querying semantic data using the PWRo. Each release includes at least a specification document in pdf format, explaining the ontology, and an rdfs file which enables its implementation as a semantic web ontology in rdfs supporting platforms and systems.

Tools

In addition to the ontology itself, we aim to provide different tools and documentation supporting the understanding and uptake of the ontology. 

Draw.iu Library

Under the tools section of this repo, you will find a draw.io library to aid in formulating diagrams and proposal using the ontology. This library has been generated following the methods established for the CIDOC CRM and implemented by the Canadian Heritage Information Network (https://www.canada.ca/en/heritage-information-network.html). The creation of the draw.io library has been made possible with their support.


This is version 1.0.

To explore past versions, please find the 'stable' branches.
